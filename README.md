## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>
The Sahel region, a semi-arid belt stretching across Africa, is a landscape of immense ecological and cultural diversity. However, it is also a region facing profound challenges. Conflicts between farmers and herders, as well as among pastoralist groups, are recurrent and often violent, driven by competition over dwindling natural resources such as land and water. These tensions are further exacerbated by climate change, which has led to prolonged droughts, desertification, and land degradation. As a result, traditional livelihoods are under threat, and communities are increasingly vulnerable to environmental and socio-economic shocks.
In this context, the role of data and technology becomes crucial. Earth observation and geospatial datasets offer a powerful lens through which we can understand and address these complex issues. By analyzing land cover changes,  vegetation productivity , climate data and population growth and  density, tracking resource availability, and mapping land degradation , we can uncover the underlying drivers of conflict and identify opportunities for sustainable land management and restoration.
