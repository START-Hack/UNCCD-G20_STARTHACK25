## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>
The Sahel region, a semi-arid belt stretching across Africa, is a landscape of immense ecological and cultural diversity. However, it is also a region facing profound challenges. Conflicts between farmers and herders, as well as among pastoralist groups, are recurrent and often violent, driven by competition over dwindling natural resources such as land and water. These tensions are further exacerbated by climate change, which has led to prolonged droughts, desertification, and land degradation. As a result, traditional livelihoods are under threat, and communities are increasingly vulnerable to environmental and socio-economic shocks.
In this context, the role of data and technology becomes crucial. Earth observation and geospatial datasets offer a powerful lens through which we can understand and address these complex issues. By analyzing land cover changes,  vegetation productivity , climate data and population growth and  density, tracking resource availability, and mapping land degradation , we can uncover the underlying drivers of conflict and identify opportunities for sustainable land management and restoration.

What is the current problem?
The hackathon invites participants to harness the power of global Earth observation data to tackle these pressing challenges . Through collaborative innovation, participants will explore solutions that promote land restoration, mitigate climate impacts, and foster peace and resilience among communities in the Sahel. By combining environmental science, technology, and social insight, this hackathon  aims to contribute to a more sustainable and equitable future for the region and beyond. Together, we can turn data into action and create meaningful change for people and the planet.
What are the key trends and primary drivers of land cover changes over the past two decades? What are the hotspots of change in vegetation productivity, and how has urban expansion influenced these patterns?
How can Earth observation data—combined with scientific insights, technological innovations, and social understanding—help address land and water conflicts, identify land degradation, uncover restoration opportunities, and inform sustainable land management strategies? Furthermore, how can this integrated approach bolster global initiatives like the G20 Global Land Restoration Initiative, empower local communities, and provide a replicable framework for other regions facing comparable challenges?
How can dashboard solutions be leveraged to visualize land cover changes and assess their impact on ecosystem health, helping stakeholders make informed decisions?

What is the expected final product?
By the end of the hackathon, participants will produce a range of actionable insights and tools that can be used to address global land cover challenges. The key deliverables include:
Dashboards: Interactive, data-driven dashboards that visualize key trends in land  cover  change, and forest cover over the past two decades. These dashboards will help stakeholders understand the scope and scale of the problem.
Country Profile: Comprehensive profile offering an in-depth analysis of land cover changes at the national and sub-national levels. These profiles will illustrate how trends have evolved over the past 20 years and provide context for future restoration efforts.
Trend Identification: Participants will analyze national areas to highlight significant trends in vegetation productivity , land degradation and deforestation. This will include identifying areas at risk and those showing signs of recovery or resilience.
Recommendations for Land Restoration: Participants will offer tailored recommendations for land restoration and mitigation strategies. These proposals could inform future policy decisions and provide actionable steps to restore degraded ecosystems.
The hackathon offers an opportunity for participants to contribute to global land restoration efforts using cutting-edge data science and environmental research. Their insights could inform policymaking, support sustainable land management, and drive positive environmental change on a global scale.
These solutions serve a diverse range of users, including policymakers, researchers, NGOs, private sector stakeholders, local communities, educators, media, and the general public. By providing actionable insights through interactive maps, time-series analysis, and ecosystem health indicators, these dashboards support evidence-based decision-making, sustainable land management, and public awareness. Tailored to meet the needs of both technical and non-technical users, they play a critical role in addressing environmental challenges and promoting conservation efforts worldwide
